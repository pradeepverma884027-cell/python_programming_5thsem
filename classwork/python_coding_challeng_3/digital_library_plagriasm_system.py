'''Digital Library Plagiarism Detector 
Problem Statement 
Two research abstracts are provided as strings. 
abstract1 = "Artificial intelligence is transforming education and healthcare."
abstract2 = "Healthcare and education are rapidly transforming through artificial intelligence." 
Tasks 
1. Convert both abstracts into sets of words.  
2. Identify common words.  
3. Identify unique words in each abstract.  
4. Calculate the percentage similarity.  
5. Display whether plagiarism review is required (similarity > 50%).  
Sample Output 
Common Words: 
{'artificial', 'intelligence', 'education', 'healthcare'} 
 
Unique Words in Abstract 1: 
{'is', 'transforming', 'and'} 
 
Unique Words in Abstract 2: 
{'are', 'rapidly', 'through', 'transforming'} 
 
Similarity Percentage: 
50.0% 
 
Plagiarism Review Required: 
No'''
